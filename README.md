# Project2-Speech-recognition-of-household-items
For this project, we attempted to replicate the way in which IoT devices identify and process speech input, and subsequently how they deliver a response to the user. The code achieves this by leveraging the SpeechRecognition library to capture and interpret spoken commands through a microphone. Upon recognizing a predefined wake word ("ok"), the assistant responds with a randomized greeting and executes various commands based on the user's input. The inclusion of date and time functions, along with the ability to control lights and open specific applications, mirrors the functionalities commonly found in voice-controlled IoT devices. The integration of web browsing capabilities for both general searches and specific platform access further extends the assistant's utility, resembling the versatile nature of modern voice-enabled devices.
